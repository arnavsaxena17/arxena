Twenty aims for developer-friendliness, and your local installation should be up and running in just a bit.

## Discord

If you have any questions or need help, you can join Twenty's [Discord](https://discord.gg/cx5n4Jzs57) server.


## Project structure

The repository has the following structure:
```
twenty
└───packages // contains this documentation
└──────twenty-front // contains the frontend code for the application
└──────twenty-server // contains the backend code for the application
└──────twenty-docker // contains docker configurations for production build
└──────other packages that are less relevant as a first step such (docs, zapier app...)
```

## IDE Setup

Once Twenty is running on your computer, you will get the best experience by using an IDE that supports TypeScript and ESLint.
You will find a guide for [VSCode](/start/local-setup/ide-setup) further in the documentation.
