The recruiter has just messaged the candidate asking if they are keen on a role and if so would they like to setup a call?
The candidate may either not reply, or reply in the affirmative or ask for which company the role is or would ask for more details. The candidate may also give a time that they would like to connect with
There are two paths now
The candidate can either be introduced to the company and the role and the job and the jd is shared and asked if they are interested
Or the candidate can be told that the role can be disguised and the candidate's interests and information is ascertained before the candidate is given the role details
The role details can be shared either in the chat or subsequently if interested, is a good fit over a telephonic call/ google meet call
In either case, there are questions and answers that are asked to the candidate before proceeding to setup a google meet
Multiple questions can be asked in one go or the recruiter might want to send one question at a time and wait for responses before asking the next question
